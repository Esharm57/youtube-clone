# Youtube Clone

## Goal

This project is a personal challenge to test and enhance my HTML and CSS skills by replicating the design and layout of YouTube, one of my most frequently used websites. The goal of this project is to recreate the core components of YouTube’s user interface, focusing solely on the front-end using only HTML and CSS.

While YouTube is a complex platform, this project will focus on static elements like:

- Header: Including the YouTube logo, search bar, and user profile menu.
- Sidebar: Replicating the navigation menu for different categories (Home, Trending, Subscriptions).
- Video Grid: Displaying video thumbnails, titles, views, and other metadata in a grid format similar to YouTube's homepage.
- Footer: Recreating the footer with links and additional information.

### Objectives:

1. Practice Layout Techniques: Use Flexbox for responsive layouts.
2. Replicate Styling: Copy typography, colors, and spacing to closely match YouTube’s design.
3. Responsive Design: Ensure the layout adjusts correctly for different screen sizes.
4. Improve Attention to Detail: Focus on pixel-perfect replication of key UI elements.
